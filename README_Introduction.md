# **Group-A_UofT_Data-Bootcamp_Final-Project**

# <ins>**Beer Reviews Analysis**</ins>

The topic we have selected for our final project is creating a machine learning algorithm that will determine the beer stlye based on select inputs. The reason for selecting this topic is because we are able to work with 3 mass datasets as well as many members in our group being self-proclaimed beer conasuers.

### <ins>**Questions we hope to answer with the data**</ins>

- Are the input variables strong indicators of the beer style?
- Do beers brewed in specific states have higher reviews?
- Which States have the highest numbers of breweries?
- Which beer style is has the highest reviews?
