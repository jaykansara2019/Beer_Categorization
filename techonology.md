# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use for storage and sharing of our dataset. 

## Machine Learning
We will use scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn to create a supervised classifcation model. We will evaluate and compare oversampling and undersampling algorithms (RandomOverSampler, SMOTE and SMOTEENN) with ensemble classifiers (random forest). We will also use unsupervised deep learning model(TensorFlow Sequential pipline) to compare and evaluate predictive accuracy with supervised ML models.

## Dashboard
We will use tableau for our data visualization and integrate with D3.js for an  interactive and dashboard.
