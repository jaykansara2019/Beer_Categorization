# Technologies Used for Our ML Model
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python and SQL.

## Database Storage
Postgres and amazon AWS is the database we intend to use for storage and sharing of our dataset. 

## Machine Learning
We will use scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn to create a supervised classifcation model. We will evaluate and compare oversampling and undersampling algorithms (RandomOverSampler, SMOTE and SMOTEENN) with ensemble classifiers (random forest). We will also use unsupervised deep learning model(TensorFlow Sequential pipeline) to compare and evaluate predictive accuracy and loss with supervised ML models and choose the best prediction model for our dataset.

## Dashboard
We will use tableau story board for our data integration and visualization for our predictive model.
